        <h1>Swimming is the process of propelling one's body through water using combined arm and leg motions for purposes like
        recreation, exercise, competition, or survival. It is a popular Olympic sport with different strokes such as butterfly,
        breaststroke, and freestyle, which can be performed in pools or open water. Beyond sport, it is also a fundamental water
        safety skill taught to children.</h1>

     <h1>basketball</h1>
     <h1>Basketball is a team sport played between two teams of five players on a rectangular court, where the main objective is
    to score points by shooting a ball through the opposing team's hoop. Points are scored through field goals (worth two or
    three points) or free throws (worth one point). The team with the most points at the end of the game wins. Players move
    the ball by dribbling (bouncing) and passing, while trying to prevent the other team from scoring.</h1>
