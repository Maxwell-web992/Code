    <p>This recipe uses a combination of dry ingredients, including all-purpose flour, cornstarch, cocoa powder, baking soda,
    and salt. The wet ingredients consist of softened unsalted butter, granulated sugar, vegetable or canola oil, large
    eggs, vanilla extract, distilled white vinegar, red food coloring gel, and buttermilk.</p>

    <h2>cake left</h2>
    <p>All you need to do is mix together flour, sugar, cinnamon, grated carrots and chopped walnuts in a bowl, and mix up
    eggs, olive oil and milk in a jug. Then simply pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredient and stir. Pour the whole
    lot into a lined cake tin (see below for cake tin lining instructions) and bake!</p>
